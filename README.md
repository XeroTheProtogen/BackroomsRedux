# Backrooms Redux
## Introduction
> If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet,
> the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in
God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you. - Unknown (If you know who said this, ping me on the discord)

Backrooms Redux is a mod that seeks to continue the legacy of Forameus' "Faithful Backrooms" & LudoCrypt's "The Corners", 
while being unique with a sanity and noclip system, interconnective with built-in addon support, and supportive of its community through guides on making addons, using LimLib and more!

## Levels
>…normal levels form the framework of the Backrooms and vary greatly in size, danger, and habitability.
>Typical levels—for whatever value of "typical" can be expected from the Backrooms—tend to be infinite in size (though "bounded" levels are not unheard of)
>and often provoke a feeling of uncanny familiarity to those happening upon them.
>The laws of physics and nature as we know them cannot be relied on in the depths of the Backrooms; nevertheless, some of the more hospitable and stable levels are home to thriving communities,
>and some inhabitants have managed to survive within even the most dangerous levels. - The Backrooms Wikidot
